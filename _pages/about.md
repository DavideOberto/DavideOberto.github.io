I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher in Numerical Analysis at SISSA, Trieste, Italy. I am a member of the MathLab group coordinated by prof. Gianluigi Rozza.
 
I got my PhD in Pure and Applied Mathematics at Politecnico di Torino in March 2025, under the supervision of Prof. Stefano Berrone. My PhD thesis focuses on using Machine Learning techniques to close the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations.

<h2>Research Interests</h2>

My research interests focus on many Computational Fluid Dynamics related topics, for example Finite Volume discretization and RANS turbulence modeling, Scientific Machine Learning to enhance classic numerical schemes with ML, and Reduced Order Modeling, both projection-based and data-driven.
